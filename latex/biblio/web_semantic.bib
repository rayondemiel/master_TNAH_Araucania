  abstract = {The idea of "Web of data"[21] has been widely enhanced by the establishment of Linked Data principles on the Web [5]. The emergence of Linking Open Data Project opens the doors to the concept of Linked Open Data, establishing the basis for publishing open data, usable by anyone on the Web. However, even though the form (Linked Data) and the goal (Web of data) have been formally defined, the definition of a components architecture to support the implementation of such technologies is still fuzzy, as is a methodology of implementation associated with this architecture. The problem is that the definition and methodology together should enable both publishing and maintenance of semantic data in a standardized way for a subset of publishers, namely public administrators. In this paper we describe a first approach to an adoption process of Web Semantic technologies, specifically with regard to tools and methods that enable the publication and maintenance of Linked Open Data within the context of public administration. To this end, we review the related basic concepts, define infrastructure, describe its components and functions, and propose a sequence to be followed. Finally, we present a case of the use of our methodology in the Library of Congress of Chile.},

  abstract = {The debate on the semantic role of markup languages has been quite lively and the TEI community has played an active part in it. It is commonly acknowledged that markup conveys semantic information. However, XML is a poor language for semantic data modeling. Several proposals have previously been drawn up in the past to provide XML with formalized and computable semantics. In our opinion, the formalisms offered by the Semantic Web paradigm are mature enough to build a workable semantic extension of the TEI.         Our model distinguishes three semantic layers in the TEI: one general and shared intensional semantic layer; one idiolectal specialized layer; and finally an extensional semantics. Our proposal is directed toward the first two layers. We propose to build such semantic layers by adopting a set of OWL formal ontologies.         Furnishing the TEI with a semantics based on a formal ontology could have interesting outcomes: facilitating the management of and research using document collections in open and multi-standard contexts; aiding interoperability with other relevant standards in the digital cultural heritage context; and providing users with advanced formal tools to semantically define their interpretations of the texts and enable innovative computational processing. In order to allow a semantic interoperability between standards, the TEI ontology has to be aligned to other models; likewise mapping and merging procedures have to be evaluated. Finally, the idea of migrating XML/TEI documents following this semantic model into a linked open data dimension requires that we face important issues in order to facilitate the data interchange in the cloud.         However, the cost and the practical complexity of such an extension are notable, and several theoretical problems, format choices, and implementation details are still to be defined.},

  abstract = {The cultural heritage sector has traditionally been concerned with sharing resources and furthering human knowledge, with particular interest to the issues associated with metadata and interoperability, especially when it comes to the use of technology. These goals and interests in the cultural heritage sector are natural alignments with those of linked data; hence. there has been an increasing interest in the application of linked data in this sector. This article studies the implementation of linked data in the cultural heritage sector, through a systematic literature review of case studies of linked data implementation projects in this sector. The results reflect on the parties involved, the level of collaboration, and the motivation behind these projects. The study suggests that universities and national institutions were the main players in implementing such technologies in the cultural heritage sector, suggesting that there may be some barriers preventing smaller GLAM institutions from implementing linked data projects. The results further suggest that many linked data projects in this sector were primarily exploratory projects, and often performed in a collaborative manner. They further indicate that the most common motivating factors behind these projects were research needs, a desire to contribute to linked data as a movement, and other specific user needs. Reflecting on this systematic literature review, this article makes a set of recommendations for future work to increase the use of linked data in the cultural heritage sector and to remove barriers to adoption.},

To address this issue, we introduce new RDF exports that connect Wikidata to the Linked Data Web. We explain the data model of Wikidata and discuss its encoding in RDF. Moreover, we introduce several partial exports that provide more selective or simplified views on the data. This includes a class hierarchy and several other types of ontological axioms that we extract from the site. All datasets we discuss here are freely available online and updated regularly.},

Deployed as part of the national infrastructure Huma-Num in France, this service provides an efficient state-of-the-art implementation coupled with standardised interfaces allowing an easy deployment on a variety of potential digital humanities contexts. The topics of accessibility and sustainability have been long discussed in the attempt of providing some best practices in the widely fragmented ecosystem of the DARIAH research infrastructure. The history of entity-fishing has been mentioned as an example of good practice: initially developed in the context of the FP9 CENDARI,1 the project was well received by the user community and continued to be further developed within the H2020 HIRMEOS project where several open access publishers have integrated the service to their collections of published monographs as a means to enhance retrieval and access.},

  abstract = {As a field of practice and research that is fast-growing and a locus for much attention and activity, open government data (OGD) has attracted stakeholders from a variety of origins. They bring with them a variety of meanings for OGD. The purpose of this paper is to show how the different stakeholders and their different perspectives on OGD can be analyzed in a given context. Taking Chile as an OGD exemplar, stakeholder analysis is used to identify and categorize stakeholder groups in terms of their relative power and interest as either primary (in this case, politicians, public officials, public sector practitioners, international organizations) or secondary (civil society activists, funding donors, ICT providers, academics). Stakeholder groups sometimes associated with OGD but absent from significant involvement in Chile – such as private sector- and citizen-users – are also identified. Four different perspectives on open government data – bureaucratic, political, technological, and economic – are identified from a literature review. Template analysis is used to analyze text – OGD-related reports, conference presentations, and interviews in Chile – in terms of those perspectives. This shows bureaucratic and political perspectives to be more dominant than the other two, and also some presence for a politico-economic perspective not identified from the original literature review. The information value chain is used to identify a “missing middle” in current Chilean OGD perspectives: a lack of connection between a reality of data provision and an aspiration of developmental results. This pattern of perspectives can be explained by the capacities and interests of key stakeholders, with those in turn being shaped by Chile's history, politics, and institutions. Overall, stakeholder analysis and perspectives analysis are shown from this case to be workable techniques for OGD that add value by exposing the identity, power, motivations, and worldview of key actors. They provide a necessary foundation of knowledge for both researchers and practitioners who need to understand the different meanings of OGD in any particular context.},

However, most entity linking approaches disregard the mention detection part, assuming that the correct mentions have been previously detected. In this paper, we perform joint learning of NER and EL to leverage their relatedness and obtain a more robust and generalisable system. For that, we introduce a model inspired by the Stack-LSTM approach (Dyer et al., 2015). We observe that, in fact, doing multi-task learning of NER and EL improves the performance in both tasks when comparing with models trained with individual objectives. Furthermore, we achieve results competitive with the state-of-the-art in both NER and EL.},

In this article, we address systematically the formal study of the database aspects of SPARQL, concentrating in its graph pattern matching facility. We provide a compositional semantics for the core part of SPARQL, and study the complexity of the evaluation of several fragments of the language. Among other complexity results, we show that the evaluation of general SPARQL patterns is PSPACE-complete. We identify a large class of SPARQL patterns, defined by imposing a simple and natural syntactic restriction, where the query evaluation problem can be solved more efficiently. This restriction gives rise to the class of well-designed patterns. We show that the evaluation problem is coNP-complete for well-designed patterns. Moreover, we provide several rewriting rules for well-designed patterns whose application may have a considerable impact in the cost of evaluating SPARQL queries.},
